When play begins, say "(Thanks to DeepSeek with help selecting spell components. Thanks also to GitHub for this demo.)"

The Deepening Glade is a room. "The forest stretches up into the hills around you. The setting sun filters through, lighting the small grassy glade in which you stand. A very small [stream] flows from north to south along the eastern edge. In the center of the glade, large and prominent, is a massive and ancient [Stone Table]."

The stream is fixed in place in the Glade. The description is "The [water]s of the crystal stream glide gently by. Its shallow blue-green shadows absorb your attention for a moment."  Instead of entering the stream, say "The stream is too small to swim in."

The blue-green water is part of the stream. Instead of doing anything with the blue-green water: say "The water seems so peaceful. You leave it to travel on its way."

The Stone Table is fixed in place and undescribed in the Glade. The description is "The table's massive legs are rooted in the earth. Its huge round top is inscribed with many [arcane runes]."

The arcane runes are part of the Stone Table. The description is "[first time]You are new to magic, but… [only]The runes seem to outline a spell for creating a [quotation mark]fetch[quotation mark]. [first time]What that is you are not sure, but you know one way to find out: make one![line break][only]The spell appears to require consuming five components: [some mustard seed], [some Dragon Tree sap], [some quicksilver], [a wax effigy], and [a Mandrake root]." Understand "top" as the arcane runes.

A spell component is a kind of thing. A spell component is always edible. After examining a spell component: say "[The noun] glows with an almost tangible mystic energy."

Section 6 - Fetched

Every turn when the player is in the Glade: if all spell components are off-stage, say "You have consumed the spell components and are ready to cast! The place is here, the time is now. You realize that laying upon the table will complete the spell, so you step on up."; now the player is on the Stone Table; say "You feel a dark energy surge through you. You see a shadowy form floating above you. You realize that this apparition is you — or rather, your 'fetch'.[paragraph break]You can feel the contents of your stomach roiling in agony; you slowly lose consciousness."; end the story.
